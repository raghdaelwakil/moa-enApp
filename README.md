"Moa'en" is a comprehensive app designed to support Alzheimer's patients and the elderly, enabling family members and caregivers to track the patient's condition and help manage daily activities and medical tasks. The app features an easy-to-use interface with multiple user paths, including three main roles: Family Helper, Caregiver, and Patient. Through "Moa'en", users can set medication reminders, track daily activities, and define safe locations for the patient. The app also allows for link sharing and direct communication between family members and caregivers, while maintaining privacy and role-based permissions. Additionally, the app includes informational content about Alzheimer's, a section for feedback, and mind games to stimulate the patient and caregivers. "Moa'n" is an essential tool for caregiving and mental well-being, offering the highest level of security and privacy for families and caregivers.
